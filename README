This is debugxslt v.0.1                                      
------------------------------
debugxslt is an experiment, to see if Schematron can be used as the basis of a kind of lint checker for XSLT.

Lint rules are defined in schematron (XSLT2 binding) schema, under sch/xslt-std.sch.

The rest of the distribution is just a small bit of code to easily run schematron (using the just released Schematron Ant Task) test suite.

LICENSE INFORMATION
-------------------

debugxslt is released under the New BSD License, a copy of which is included in this distribution in a file named LICENSE


INSTALLATION & PREREQUISITES
----------------------------

To use the distribution and run unit tests you will need to install following dependencies

	Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org) 
	
	Schematron Ant Task (http://www.schematron.com) download and place in lib/schematron

	XSLT v2.0 processor, we recommend using Michael Kay SAXON, download and place in lib/saxon

You will have to edit the build.properties file to inform debugxslt where SAXON and Schematron Ant task is.

If you are using debugxslt bash script, you will have to edit ant -lib flag to reflect location of saxon jars

RUN
---

You can use the bash run script to check single XSLT files

> debugxslt myfile.xsl

to run debugxslt test suite run ant Test target

> ant -lib lib/saxon -f build.xml test

Another (perhaps simpler way) option is to just take the rules schematron and run in your own setup.
