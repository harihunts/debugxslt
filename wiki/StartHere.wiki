#summary How to get debugxslt and install & use against your own xslt.

= Getting debugxslt =

So far I have not released any packaged version of debugxslt ... so your only method of getting it is by checking out from [http://code.google.com/p/debugxslt/source subversion].

{{{
# Non-members may svn check out a read-only working copy anonymously over HTTP.
svn checkout http://debugxlst.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ debugxslt-read-only
}}}



= Installation and Dependencies =

If you are using the full distribution you will need the following;

[http://debugxslt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README README]

*I*: XSLT v2.0 processor, I recommend downloading Michael Kay's Saxon from www.saxonica.com. You will have to unzip (pref in /lib dir) and amend build.properties as to location and saxon jar name

*II*: Apache Ant [http://ant.apache.org Apache Ant] is required to run 

*III*: [http://www.schematron.com/resource/2007-02-16-ant-schematron-sample.zip Download] Schematron Ant Task and expand under lib/schematron.

*IV*: Amend your local [http://debugxslt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build.properties build properties] to reflect your setup and where your XSLT processor jars are.

*V*: Amend debugxslt run script with where your XSLT processor is (using Ant -lib flag)

You do not have to use the distribution, you could just
