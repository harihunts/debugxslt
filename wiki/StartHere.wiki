#summary How to get debugxslt and install & use against your own xslt.

= Getting debugxslt =

So far I have not released any packaged version of debugxslt ... so your only method of getting it is by checking out from [http://code.google.com/p/debugxslt/source subversion].

{{{
# Non-members may svn check out a read-only working copy anonymously over HTTP.
svn checkout http://debugxlst.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ debugxslt-read-only
}}}


= Installation and Dependencies =

Most up to date definition of dependencies is contained in the source code [http://debugxslt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README README]

*I*: One needs an XSLT v2.0 processor (I test with Saxon-SA) to run xproc.xq.

*II*: For now, one will require [http://ant.apache.org Apache Ant] to run unit tests and compile associated artifacts.

*III*: For now, use Schematron Ant Task.

*IV*: Amend your local [http://debugxslt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/build.properties build properties] to reflect your setup and where your XSLT processor jars are.


= Usage =

to get Ant targets, run Apache Ant with -projecthelp switch  

> ant -projecthelp

Buildfile: build.xml
