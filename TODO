some more ideas for rules I would like to implement;

	Duplicate match patterns

	Unused defined modes

	Undefined modes

	Undefined named templates

	unused defined named templates

	Templates that use name= where match= was probably intended

	xsl:call-template elements that contain anything other than xsl:with-param

	Variable/parameter references that are not defined at the point of use

	Forgot to add @ to attribute, common with prefixed attributes

here the following rules would be interested in case sensitivity in elements, attributes and params/vars
	Same name different caps when addressing element
	Same name different caps with attributes
	Same name different caps with param/var

the following rules are for content that is not well formed

	added ending angle bracket in middle of xsl:stylesheet element
	Missing quote in select statement
